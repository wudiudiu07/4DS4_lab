build a prototype embedded system on the DE2 board that emulates the digital part of an elevator with following input/output behavior and assumptions/constraints.
INPUT
1. SWITCH_I[16] sets up the amount of time the elevator spends between floors, PUSH_BUTTON_I[2] activates the new value
2. SWITCH_I[15] sets up the amount of time the elevator speends at each floor while the doors are open, and PUSH_BUTTON_I[1] activates the new value.
3. SWITCH_I[11] down to SWITCH_I[0] are used to indicate the corresponding floor that the elevator will go to
4. PUSH_BUTTON_I[3] will keep the dooor open even if the interrupt to close the door is generated after an elevator reaches the floor.

OUTPUT
1. The rightmost seven segment display should show the floor number where the elevator is located
2. RED_LED_O[11] down to RED_LED_O[0] will be lighted on when a request has been made at the corresponding floor and be turned off as soon as the elevator reaches the floor.
